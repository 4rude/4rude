- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt, a.k.a.@4rude
- 👀 I’m interested in an ever increasing amount of topics. Here are a bunch of them:
  -Psychology/Sociology -> Comp Sci/ML -> Poli Sci -> Philosophy -> Math/Physics/Chemistry -> Econ -> Marketing 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about everything I listed above. I'm hungry for knowledge and habitually interested in understanding life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on combating racial and income inequality using data science to educate ourselves and our fellow world citizens 🌍❤️
